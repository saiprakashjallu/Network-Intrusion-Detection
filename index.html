                  ML in Intrusion Detection
                </h3>
                <p>
                In the case of Intrusion Detection, learning
involves discovering patterns of normal behavior or intrusive behavior by analyzing the
sample data of such activities. This sample data is also called a training set. It should be
sufficient to represent the whole population of patterns to be discovered. The learned
models can then be used to make classification on a new data instance based on its similarity
to normal behavior (anomaly detection) or known attack signatures (misuse detection).
Many security systems have implemented ML to achieve a generalization capability from
limited training data. That means, given known intrusion signatures, a security system
should be able to detect similar or new attacks.

            <h4><strong>The Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Benchmark</strong></h4>
            <p class="text-intro">Current security systems are facing two fundamental challenges. First, the unbalanced
nature of security dataset indicates dramatic changes in the distribution of classes compared
with the normal trends. Second, increased dimensionality, especially when noise is
involved, can degrade learning significantly. Together, these two
characteristics make the detecting intrusive activities very challenging</p>

            <p class="text-intro">The KDD-99 dataset has simulated the two challenging problems namely,
the unbalanced nature and high dimensionality of security data. Each connection record in the KDD-99 dataset is labeled as either normal or one type of
attack. There are totally 39 types of attacks which are grouped into 4 major categories
Probe, Denial of Service (DoS), User to Root (U2R) and Remote to
Local (R2L). </p>

			<h3><strong> Overview on VQ-GRNN(Vector
Quantized – Generalized Regression Neural Network)</strong></h4>
			<br>
			<p class="text-intro">  
			A family of ANN models, <strong>RBFNN</strong>(Radial Basis Function Neural Networks), has recently drawn great research attention due to its
good generalization ability and a simple network structure that avoids unnecessary and
lengthy calculations. Considering the node characteristics and the training algorithms, RBFNN are very
different from Multilayer Feedforward Networks (MFN). The node characteristics for MFN are usually chosen as sigmoidal
functions while for RBFNN, as indicated in the name, radial basis functions are employed. A
popular algorithm in RFBNN family is the Generalized Regression Neural Network
(GRNN) which contains a hidden layer of radial units.
Each radial unit models a Gaussian response surface which can be determined by its center
point and a radius. Because these functions are nonlinear, it is enough for a single hidden
layer to describe any shape of function. The output of these Gaussians is then linearly
weighted to produce the desirable response. </p>

fast enough not to cause bottlenecks in communication networks.</p>

take a different approach with normal ml algorithms. Rather than finding one best learner to explain the data, they
construct a set of learners, called a committee or ensemble, and then have those learners vote
in some manner to predict the label of new data points.</p>

that combines learners in such a way that the composite – boosted learner – outperforms the
single learner. E.g.- AdaBoost.</p>

              <p>Different learning algorithms behave variably on different classes. They may obtain superior
performance on some classes but present unacceptable low accuracy for others. The
imbalance of predictive performance motivates to construct an intelligent
multi-expert learning framework which can aggregate expert knowledge from class-specific

<p>For a multi-class classification problem such as network intrusion detection, instead of
trying to design a learning algorithm that is accurate over the entire space, we can focus on
creating a model that can predict well for a specific portion within the space. We then
combine such models to obtain a joint classifier which performs accurately on many classes.</p>

            <hr>
            <ol>
              <li> Multi-Expert Classification Framework (MECF) in which Vector
Quantized Generalized Regression Neural Network (VQ-GRNN) and Adaptive Boosting
(AdaBoost) are deployed. It is shown that some learning algorithms that use certain sets of
features and class-specific encoding schemes can achieve superior detection capability for a
given attack category. Consequently, MECF aims to capture the characteristics of different
intrusive classes and normal instances by constructing a set of five local classifiers (experts)
to classify data into five different classes including Normal, Probe, DoS, U2R and R2L. For
each of these classes, a tailored learning strategy (an expert) is employed. The outcomes of
these experts will then be combined using high performance voting methods.</li>
              <li>However, no system is absolutely secure given the best possible
detection algorithms. That is true as long as the system is connected to other networks. The
absolute security can only be achieved by disconnecting the system from the outside world
which is against the principal benefits of internetworking – accessibility of information. This
means that protecting our resources from network attacks is an ongoing task and computer
security is always an active and challenging research area.</li>
