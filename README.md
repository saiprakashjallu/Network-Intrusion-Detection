Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning Techniques

Computer Networks have been in existence for a quite long time and are a blessing since it has brought people and the world closer to each other. The complexity associated with the Internet is vast, with unanticipated risks and vulnerabilities. Today the threat of intrusion and privacy of these networks is enormous as a response to intrusion origin of the notion of intrusion detection was coined.


# ML in Intrusion Detection

In the case of Intrusion Detection, learning involves discovering patterns of normal behavior or intrusive behavior by analyzing the sample data of such activities. This sample data is also called a training set. It should be sufficient to represent the whole population of patterns to be discovered. The learned models can then be used to make classification on a new data instance based on its similarity to normal behavior (anomaly detection) or known attack signatures (misuse detection). Many security systems have implemented ML to achieve a generalization capability from limited training data. That means, given known intrusion signatures, a security system should be able to detect similar or new attacks.
